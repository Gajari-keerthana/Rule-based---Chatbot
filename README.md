**Objective**:
The primary objective of this rule-based chatbot is to enhance the learning experience for students by providing timely and automated assistance with frequently asked questions and common problems encountered on the EdTech platform.
Goals:
● Deliver instant support to students 24/7.
● Help resolve common student issues like login failures, enrollment status, and
assignment submission errors.
● Improve student experience by reducing waiting times for help.
● Reduce the number of support tickets for the student services team.
Non-Goals:
● The chatbot will not replace human support for complex or escalated issues.
● It will not process real-time transactions (e.g., payment processing).
● Initially, it will not include deep NLP or generative responses (LLM to be explored in
later versions).
User Stories:
- I want to reset my password so I can log in to my account.
- I want to check my course enrollment status so I can attend classes on time.
- I want to know the schedule of my courses so I can plan my week.
